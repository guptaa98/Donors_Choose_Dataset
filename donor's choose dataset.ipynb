      "\\\"The only way to learn mathematics is to do mathematics.\\\"\\r\\n-Paul Halmos.\\r\\nMy students love math time and using the hands-on manipulative's to make sense of what is being taught.My students love coming to school and working as hard as they can to learn new concepts everyday.  They especially love working with the math manipulative's and they are always coming up with new discoveries.\\r\\nOur school is a Title I school where over 50% of our population receives free or reduced lunch. Many of these children come from low-income families but this doesn't hinder their desire to learn.My students will be using these math manipulative's on a daily basis during our math block time.  The students will each have opportunities to explore and make connections that make math more concrete and help them relate to the concepts being taught.\\r\\nThey will be learning about our base ten number system and learn about money which are both important real life skills.Learning about money is important so the students can feel independent when they are given or earn money. They will be able to have a real sense of how much they can buy with certain amounts of money.  \\r\\nI'm so excited to watch them exchange pennies for other coins and learn to save their classroom money for purchases in our store.\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "My students are energetic 6 and 7 year olds who love to learn.   They are vibrant and playful in their daily activities.  They love to  engage and learn in ways that make learning fun and memorable.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvironment shapes experience.  Where do you enjoy reading?  Do you like to read in the shade, on the beach, or in your bed at night?   My students are more productive, engaged, and happy when they are allowed to read in ways that make reading magical.\\r\\nI teach first grade in an Indianapolis Public School.  My school's population is 80% Hispanic. 90% of our students receive free or reduced priced lunch and 66% of them are English Language Learners.  School is a safe place for my students, and they are excited to be there.  My students love reading, but I want to provide them with reading experiences that make their reading time magical in ways they may have never experienced.Reading is my passion and has always been an activity I do whenever possible.  As a child, I loved getting a flashlight and reading under my covers while I was supposed to be sleeping.  I will never forget that feeling.  I want my students to look forward to the joy of reading \\\"in the dark\\\"  by having Flashlight Fridays!   Students will each have their own rechargeable flashlight to use each Friday as I close the shades, turn out the lights, and let the magic begin.  I want this practice to become a habit, so that they will continue to read in the dark, at night, long after they take home their very own flashlight and make their own magic at home!nannan\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "My students are hard working, humble and have huge hearts. There attitude and work ethic shine distinctly against the background of where they live and come from. Our school is a Title I school where over 95% of the students are on free or reduced lunch. \\r\\n    Our school as a very large population of first generation Americans. Many of their families sacrificed very much to give their children the hope and opportunities our country can provide. This unfortunately does not always afford the students the luxuries of their peers in other places. \\r\\n    My students may lack many of the modern comforts enjoyed by others their age. They may not have the newest clothes, shoes or technology but it does not dampen their spirit. They have a wonderful zest for learning and an innate drive. That is why it is so vital, that they see a small recognition of their effort. So we may cultivate this spirit and energy to propel them forward.Equipping my students with new sneakers for the basketball season will have a huge impact in terms of functionality and confidence. \\r\\n    The students I work with put in tremendous effort, but often find themselves embarrassed when they step on the court. Many do not have money for new sneakers or basketball sneakers at all. We borrow, lend and make do.\\r\\n     With the benefit of new sneakers for the team the students will perform better (cutting, running, jumping), but more importantly they will feel better about themselves. They will hold their heads high every time they compete.  \\r\\n      The proper basketball sneaker is not just an issue of cosmetics. The sneakers we have selected will provide the proper support to help avoid foot, ankle and knee injuries. My students should not have to compete with a higher injury risk just because they are less well of financially.\\r\\n      Teenagers very much associate how they act and feel with how they look. They can also at times be cruel to each other. When my students step on the court I want them to be focused on doing their best not worried about the ridicule and self doubt that can come from having old, beat up sneakers.  \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n  \\r\\nnannan\n",
